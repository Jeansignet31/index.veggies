I went one day to the kansas city market place to buy the veggies and other staff there when i get there i couldn't find anythyng.
Sencond week on saturday then i found out the egg white for chip price and i was pretty much happy for gettting the veggies  i like.

when people are in that market there is too much crowd for sure and sometime it is scared for getting some kind of deseases, especially with Covid-19.
but it is fine being there with other people for those they like staying and see how people are joyfull.

Most busineses owner are friendly and cheerfully when they see customer, but one thing I realized there was i met the woman selling the the veggies i love a lot and her husband, when he sees me 
he din't want me speak with that woman and i din't notice that if she was with her spouse even if I had no bad conversation, was just customer and seller conversation.
Since then i never went back again because scared of being in trouble with men.>
